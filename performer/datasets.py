        This is called once per epoch and is not shuffled, because the order of genes and people will be shuffled by the dataset object at each epoch. Instead, these
        indices are kept the same to ensure the data ordering by the dataset is maintained, and each batch only contains samples of one gene on each gpu
        
        How this works: Suppose I have 937 genes, and want each GPU to be trained using data from 6 people for the same gene per batch. And I have 4 GPUs. 
        Each GPU will be assigned 937 //4 = 234 genes. One gene will be ignored.
        For a GPU 0 will be assigned indices 0 to 1403, GPU1 will get 1404 to 1807 etc Because:
        For GPU 0 the start group will be 0 * 234 = 0 and the end group will be 0 + 234 = 234. The indices will be extended by 6 for each element from 0->234, yielding a list that spans 0 to 1403 (inclusive)
        For GPU 1 the start group will be 234 and the end group will be 468. And so forth
        The final GPU will span 4212 to 5615 (inclusive) because the last gene is dropped, since there is not 3 other genes (one per GPU)
        Then, each batch, indices 0-6 will be sampled, then 7-12 and so on. The dataset is organized such that this yields samples for a given gene.


        if use_all_ppl is True, and dataset.n_gene_replicate_batches_per_epoch >1, it is possible that some genes won't see all people in the batch (But they will always see a multiple of num_individuals_per_gene). 
        This is beacuse, instead of certain genes being ommitted to make things even across the replicas, certain gradient accumulated batches of length (num_individuals_per_gene) for certain genes may be ommitted instead.

        If use all_pppl is true then the same gene may appear on different GPUs, but only as different gradient accumulated effective batches
